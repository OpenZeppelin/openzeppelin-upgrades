= OpenZeppelin Truffle Upgrades API

WARNING: This package is deprecated. The recommended alternative is to use https://hardhat.org/[Hardhat] along with the xref:hardhat-upgrades.adoc[Hardhat Upgrades] plugin.

Both `deployProxy` and `upgradeProxy` functions will return instances of https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/contract-abstractions[Truffle contracts], and require Truffle contract classes (retrieved via `artifacts.require`) as arguments. For https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#beacon[beacons], `deployBeacon` and `upgradeBeacon` will both return an upgradable beacon instance that can be used with a beacon proxy. All deploy and upgrade functions validate that the implementation contract is upgrade-safe, and will fail otherwise.

[[common-options]]
== Common Options

The following options are common to some functions.

* `deployer`: Should be set to the Truffle migration deployer during migrations.
* `kind`: (`"uups" | "transparent" | "beacon"`) The kind of proxy to deploy, upgrade or import, or the kind of proxy that the implementation will be used with. `deployProxy()` and `upgradeProxy()` only support the values `"uups" | "transparent"`. Defaults to `"transparent"`. See xref:contracts:api:proxy.adoc#transparent-vs-uups[Transparent vs UUPS].
* `unsafeAllow`: (`ValidationError[]`) Selectively disable one or more validation errors:
** `"external-library-linking"`: Allows a deployment with external libraries linked to the implementation contract. (External libraries are otherwise xref:faq.adoc#why-cant-i-use-external-libraries[not yet supported].)
** `"struct-definition"`, `"enum-definition"`: Used to be necessary to deploy a contract with structs or enums. No longer necessary.
** `"state-variable-assignment"`: Allows assigning state variables in a contract even though they will be stored in the implementation.
** `"state-variable-immutable"`: Allows use of immutable variables, which are not unsafe
** `"constructor"`: Allows defining a constructor. See `constructorArgs`.
** `"delegatecall"`, `"selfdestruct"`: Allow the use of these operations. Incorrect use of this option can put funds at risk of permanent loss. See xref:faq.adoc#delegatecall-selfdestruct[Can I safely use `delegatecall` and `selfdestruct`?]
** `"missing-public-upgradeto"`: Allow UUPS implementations that do not contain a public `upgradeTo` or `upgradeToAndCall` function. Enabling this option is likely to cause a revert due to the built-in UUPS safety mechanism.
* `unsafeAllowRenames`: (`boolean`) Configure storage layout check to allow variable renaming.
* `unsafeSkipStorageCheck`: (`boolean`) upgrades the proxy or beacon without first checking for storage layout compatibility errors. This is a dangerous option meant to be used as a last resort.
* `constructorArgs`: (`unknown[]`) Provide arguments for the constructor of the implementation contract. Note that these are different from initializer arguments, and will be used in the deployment of the implementation contract itself. Can be used to initialize immutable variables.
* `redeployImplementation`: (`"always" | "never" | "onchange"`) Determines whether the implementation contract will be redeployed. Defaults to `"onchange"`.
** If set to `"always"`, the implementation contract is always redeployed even if it was previously deployed with the same bytecode.
** If set to `"never"`, the implementation contract is never redeployed. If the implementation contract was not previously deployed or is not found in the network file, an error will be thrown.
** If set to `"onchange"`, the implementation contract is redeployed only if the bytecode has changed from previous deployments.
* `txOverrides`: (`TruffleTxOptions`) A Truffle https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/contracts/run-migrations/#deployerdeploycontract-args-options[options] object to override transaction parameters, such as `gas` and `gasPrice`. Applies to all transactions sent by a function with this option, even if the function sends multiple transactions.

Note that the options `unsafeAllow` can also be specified in a more granular way directly in the source code if using Solidity >=0.8.2. See xref:faq.adoc#how-can-i-disable-checks[How can I disable some of the checks?]

The following options have been deprecated.

* `unsafeAllowLinkedLibraries`: Equivalent to including `"external-library-linking"` in `unsafeAllow`.
* `unsafeAllowCustomTypes`: Equivalent to including `"struct-definition"` and `"enum-definition"` in `unsafeAllow`. No longer necessary.
* `useDeployedImplementation`: (`boolean`) Equivalent to setting `redeployImplementation` to `"never"`.

[[deploy-proxy]]
== deployProxy

[source,ts]
----
async function deployProxy(
  Contract: ContractClass,
  args: unknown[] = [],
  opts?: {
    deployer?: Deployer,
    initializer?: string | false,
    unsafeAllow?: ValidationError[],
    constructorArgs?: unknown[],
    timeout?: number,
    pollingInterval?: number,
    redeployImplementation?: 'always' | 'never' | 'onchange',
    txOverrides?: TruffleTxOptions,
    kind?: 'uups' | 'transparent',
  },
): Promise<ContractInstance>
----

Creates a UUPS or Transparent proxy given a Truffle contract class to use as implementation, and returns a contract instance with the proxy address and the implementation interface. During a migration, the proxy address will be stored in the implementation contract's artifact, so you can use Truffle's https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/contract-abstractions#-code-mycontract-deployed-code-[`deployed()`] function to load it.

If `args` is set, will call an initializer function `initialize` with the supplied `args` during proxy deployment.

If you call `deployProxy` several times for the same implementation contract, several proxies will be deployed, but only one implementation contract will be used.

*Parameters:*

* `Contract` - a Truffle contract class to use as the implementation.
* `args` - arguments for the initializer function.
* `opts` - an object with options:
** `initializer`: set a different initializer function to call, or specify `false` to disable initialization
** See <<common-options>>.

*Returns:*

* a contract instance with the proxy address and the implementation interface.

CAUTION: When importing a proxy or beacon, the `deployedImpl` argument must be the contract class of the *current* implementation contract version that is being used, not the version that you are planning to upgrade to.

Use this function to recreate a lost https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/network-files[network file] by importing previous deployments, or to register proxies or beacons for upgrading even if they were not originally deployed by this plugin. Supported for UUPS, Transparent, and Beacon proxies, as well as beacons and implementation contracts.

* `deployedImpl` - the Truffle contract class of the implementation contract that was deployed.
* `opts` - an object with options:
** `kind`: (`"uups" | "transparent" | "beacon"`) forces a proxy to be treated as a UUPS, Transparent, or Beacon proxy. If not provided, the proxy kind will be automatically detected.

*Returns:*

* a contract instance representing the imported proxy, beacon or implementation.
