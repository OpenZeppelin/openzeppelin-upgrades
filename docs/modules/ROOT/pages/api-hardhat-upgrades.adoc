= OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades API

Both `deployProxy` and `upgradeProxy` functions will return instances of https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract[ethers.js contracts], and require https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract-factory[ethers.js contract factories] as arguments. All functions validate that the implementation contract is upgrade-safe, and will fail otherwise.

[[common-options]]
== Common Options

The following options are common to all functions.

* `kind`: (`"uups" | "transparent"`) Choose between a UUPS or Transparent proxy. Defaults to Transparent. See xref:contracts:api:proxy.adoc#transparent-vs-uups[Transparent vs UUPS].
* `unsafeAllow`: (`ValidationError[]`) Selectively disable one or more validation errors:
** `"external-library-linking"`: Allows a deployment with external libraries linked to the implementation contract. (External libraries are otherwise xref:faq.adoc#why-cant-i-use-external-libraries[not yet supported].)
** `"struct-definition"`, `"enum-definition"`: Used to be necessary to deploy a contract with structs or enums. No longer necessary.
** `"state-variable-assignment"`: Allows assigning state variables in a contract even though they will be stored in the implementation.
** `"state-variable-immutable"`: Allows use of immutable variables, which are not unsafe
** `"constructor"`: Allows defining a constructor. Note that constructor arguments are not supported regardless of this option.
** `"delegatecall"`, `"selfdestruct"`: Allow the use of these operations. Incorrect use of this option can put funds at risk of permanent loss. See xref:faq.adoc#delegatecall-selfdestruct[Can I safely use `delegatecall` and `selfdestruct`?]
** `"missing-public-upgradeto"`: Allow UUPS implementations that do not contain a public `upgradeTo` function. Enabling this option is likely to cause a revert due to the built-in UUPS safety mechanism.
* `unsafeAllowRenames`: (`boolean`) Configure storage layout check to allow variable renaming.
* `constructorArgs`: (`unknown[]`) Provide arguments for the constructor of the implementation contract. Note that these are different from initializer arguments, and will be used in the deployment of the implementation contract itself. Can be used to initialize immutable variables.

Note that the options un `unsafeAllow` can also be specified in a more granular way directly in the source code if using Solidity >=0.8.2. See xref:faq.adoc#how-can-i-disable-checks[How can I disable some of the checks?]

The following options have been deprecated.

* `unsafeAllowLinkedLibraries`: Equivalent to including `"external-library-linking"` in `unsafeAllow`.
* `unsafeAllowCustomTypes`: Equivalent to including `"struct-definition"` and `"enum-definition"` in `unsafeAllow`. No longer necessary.

[[deploy-proxy]]
== deployProxy

Creates a proxy given an ethers contract factory to use as implementation, and returns a contract instance with the proxy address and the implementation interface. If `args` is set, will call an initializer function `initialize` with the supplied args during proxy deployment.

If you call `deployProxy` several times for the same implementation contract, several proxies will be deployed, but only one implementation contract will be used.

* `initializer`: set a different initializer function to call (see https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/abi/interface/#Interface--specifying-fragments[Specifying Fragments]), or specify `false` to disable initialization
* See <<common-options>>.

[source,ts]
----
async function deployProxy(
  Contract: ethers.ContractFactory,
  args: unknown[] = [],
  opts: {
    initializer: string | false,
    unsafeAllow: ValidationError[],
    kind: 'uups' | 'transparent',
  } = {},
): Promise<ethers.Contract>
----

[[upgrade-proxy]]
== upgradeProxy

Upgrades a proxy at a specified address to a new implementation contract, and returns a contract instance with the proxy address and the new implementation interface.

See <<common-options>>.

[source,ts]
----
async function upgradeProxy(
  proxyAddress: string,
  Contract: ethers.ContractFactory,
  opts: {
    unsafeAllow: ValidationError[],
  } = {},
): Promise<ethers.Contract>
----

[[prepare-upgrade]]
== prepareUpgrade

Validates and deploys a new implementation contract, and returns its address. Use this method to prepare an upgrade to be run from an admin address you do not control directly or cannot use from Hardhat.

See <<common-options>>.

[source,ts]
----
async function prepareUpgrade(
  proxyAddress: string,
  Contract: ethers.ContractFactory,
  opts: {
    unsafeAllow: ValidationError[],
  } = {},
): Promise<string>
----

[[defender-propose-upgrade]]
== defender.proposeUpgrade

NOTE: This method requires the https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openzeppelin/hardhat-defender[`@openzeppelin/hardhat-defender`] package, as well as configuring a Defender Team API Key.

Similar to `prepareUpgrade`. This method validates and deploys the new implementation contract, but also creates an upgrade proposal in https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/admin[Defender Admin], for review and approval by the upgrade administrators.

* `title`: title of the upgrade proposal as seen in Defender Admin, defaults to `Upgrade to 0x12345678` (using the first 8 digits of the new implementation address)
* `description`: description of the upgrade proposal as seen in Defender Admin, defaults to the full implementation address.
* `multisig`: address of the multisignature wallet contract with the rights to execute the upgrade. This is autodetected in https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy[Transparent proxies], but required for https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable[UUPS proxies] (read more https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#transparent-vs-uups[here]). Both Gnosis Safe and Gnosis MultisigWallet multisigs are supported.
* `proxyAdmin`: address of the https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#ProxyAdmin[`ProxyAdmin`] contract that manages the proxy, if exists. This is autodetected in https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy[Transparent proxies], but required for https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable[UUPS proxies] (read more https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#transparent-vs-uups[here]), though UUPS proxies typically do not require the usage of a ProxyAdmin.

* See <<common-options>>.
