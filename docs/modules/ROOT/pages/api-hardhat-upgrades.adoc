= OpenZeppelin Hardhat Upgrades API

Both `deployProxy` and `upgradeProxy` functions will return instances of https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract[ethers.js contracts], and require https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract-factory[ethers.js contract factories] as arguments. For https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#beacon[beacons], `deployBeacon` and `upgradeBeacon` will both return an upgradable beacon instance that can be used with a beacon proxy. All deploy and upgrade functions validate that the implementation contract is upgrade-safe, and will fail otherwise.

[[common-options]]
== Common Options

The following options are common to some functions.

* `kind`: (`"uups" | "transparent" | "beacon"`) The kind of proxy to deploy, upgrade or import, or the kind of proxy that the implementation will be used with. `deployProxy()` and `upgradeProxy()` only support the values `"uups" | "transparent"`. Defaults to `"transparent"`. See xref:contracts:api:proxy.adoc#transparent-vs-uups[Transparent vs UUPS].
* `unsafeAllow`: (`ValidationError[]`) Selectively disable one or more validation errors:
** `"external-library-linking"`: Allows a deployment with external libraries linked to the implementation contract. (External libraries are otherwise xref:faq.adoc#why-cant-i-use-external-libraries[not yet supported].)
** `"struct-definition"`, `"enum-definition"`: Used to be necessary to deploy a contract with structs or enums. No longer necessary.
** `"state-variable-assignment"`: Allows assigning state variables in a contract even though they will be stored in the implementation.
** `"state-variable-immutable"`: Allows use of immutable variables, which are not unsafe
** `"constructor"`: Allows defining a constructor. See `constructorArgs`.
** `"delegatecall"`, `"selfdestruct"`: Allow the use of these operations. Incorrect use of this option can put funds at risk of permanent loss. See xref:faq.adoc#delegatecall-selfdestruct[Can I safely use `delegatecall` and `selfdestruct`?]
** `"missing-public-upgradeto"`: Allow UUPS implementations that do not contain a public `upgradeTo` or `upgradeToAndCall` function. Enabling this option is likely to cause a revert due to the built-in UUPS safety mechanism.
* `unsafeAllowRenames`: (`boolean`) Configure storage layout check to allow variable renaming.
* `unsafeSkipStorageCheck`: (`boolean`) upgrades the proxy or beacon without first checking for storage layout compatibility errors. This is a dangerous option meant to be used as a last resort.
* `constructorArgs`: (`unknown[]`) Provide arguments for the constructor of the implementation contract. Note that these are different from initializer arguments, and will be used in the deployment of the implementation contract itself. Can be used to initialize immutable variables.
* `initialOwner`: (`string`) the address to set as the initial owner of a transparent proxy's admin or initial owner of a beacon. Defaults to the externally owned account that is deploying the transparent proxy or beacon. Not supported for UUPS proxies.
** *Since:* `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades@3.0.0`
* `timeout`: (`number`) Timeout in milliseconds to wait for the transaction confirmation when deploying an implementation contract. Defaults to `60000`. Use `0` to wait indefinitely.
* `pollingInterval`: (`number`) Polling interval in milliseconds between checks for the transaction confirmation when deploying an implementation contract. Defaults to `5000`.
* `redeployImplementation`: (`"always" | "never" | "onchange"`) Determines whether the implementation contract will be redeployed. Defaults to `"onchange"`.
** If set to `"always"`, the implementation contract is always redeployed even if it was previously deployed with the same bytecode. This can be used with the `salt` option when deploying a proxy through OpenZeppelin Defender to ensure that the implementation contract is deployed with the same salt as the proxy.
** If set to `"never"`, the implementation contract is never redeployed. If the implementation contract was not previously deployed or is not found in the network file, an error will be thrown.
** If set to `"onchange"`, the implementation contract is redeployed only if the bytecode has changed from previous deployments.
* `txOverrides`: (`ethers.Overrides`) An ethers.js https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/contract/#Overrides[Overrides] object to override transaction parameters, such as `gasLimit` and `gasPrice`. Applies to all transactions sent by a function with this option, even if the function sends multiple transactions. For OpenZeppelin Defender deployments, only the `gasLimit`, `gasPrice`, `maxFeePerGas`, and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` parameters are supported.
* `useDefenderDeploy`: (`boolean`) Deploy contracts using OpenZeppelin Defender instead of ethers.js. See xref:defender-deploy.adoc[Using with OpenZeppelin Defender].
* `verifySourceCode`: (`boolean`) When using OpenZeppelin Defender deployments, whether to verify source code on block explorers. Defaults to `true`.
* `relayerId`: (`string`) When using OpenZeppelin Defender deployments, the ID of the relayer to use for the deployment. Defaults to the relayer configured for your deployment environment on Defender.
* `salt`: (`string`) When using OpenZeppelin Defender deployments, if this is not set, deployments will be performed using the CREATE opcode. If this is set, deployments will be performed using the CREATE2 opcode with the provided salt. Note that deployments using a Safe are done using CREATE2 and require a salt. **Warning:** CREATE2 affects `msg.sender` behavior. See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/v2/tutorial/deploy#deploy-caveat[Caveats] for more information.



Note that the options `unsafeAllow` can also be specified in a more granular way directly in the source code if using Solidity >=0.8.2. See xref:faq.adoc#how-can-i-disable-checks[How can I disable some of the checks?]

The following options have been deprecated.

* `unsafeAllowLinkedLibraries`: Equivalent to including `"external-library-linking"` in `unsafeAllow`.
* `unsafeAllowCustomTypes`: Equivalent to including `"struct-definition"` and `"enum-definition"` in `unsafeAllow`. No longer necessary.
* `useDeployedImplementation`: (`boolean`) Equivalent to setting `redeployImplementation` to `"never"`.

NOTE: This method requires configuring a Defender Team API Key.

Proposes an upgrade using https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/admin[Defender Admin].

Similar to `prepareUpgrade`. This method validates and deploys the new implementation contract, but also creates an upgrade proposal in Defender Admin, for review and approval by the upgrade administrators. Supported for UUPS or Transparent proxies. Not currently supported for beacon proxies or beacons. For beacons, use `prepareUpgrade` along with a custom action in Defender Admin to upgrade the beacon to the deployed implementation.

*Parameters:*

* `proxyAddress` - the proxy address.
* `ImplFactory` - the new implementation contract.
* `opts` - an object with options:
** `title`: title of the upgrade proposal as seen in Defender Admin, defaults to `Upgrade to 0x12345678` (using the first 8 digits of the new implementation address)
** `description`: description of the upgrade proposal as seen in Defender Admin, defaults to the full implementation address.
** `multisig`: address of the multisignature wallet contract with the rights to execute the upgrade. This is autodetected in https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy[Transparent proxies], but required for https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable[UUPS proxies] (read more https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#transparent-vs-uups[here]). Both Gnosis Safe and Gnosis MultisigWallet multisigs are supported.
** `proxyAdmin`: address of the https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#ProxyAdmin[`ProxyAdmin`] contract that manages the proxy, if exists. This is autodetected in https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy[Transparent proxies], but required for https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable[UUPS proxies] (read more https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#transparent-vs-uups[here]), though UUPS proxies typically do not require the usage of a ProxyAdmin.
** additional options as described in <<common-options>>.

*Returns:*

Extends https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify[hardhat-verify]'s `verify` task to completely verify a proxy on Etherscan.  This supports verifying proxy contracts that were deployed by the Hardhat Upgrades plugin.

The arguments are the same as for hardhat-verify's `verify` task.  If the provided address is a proxy, this task will verify the proxy's implementation contract, the proxy itself and any proxy-related contracts, as well as link the proxy to the implementation contract's ABI on Etherscan.  If the provided address is not a proxy, the regular `verify` task from hardhat-verify will be run on the address instead.

The following contracts will be verified when you run this task on your proxy address:

* Your implementation contract
* https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#ERC1967Proxy[ERC1967Proxy] or https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy[TransparentUpgradeableProxy] or https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#BeaconProxy[BeaconProxy] (for UUPS, transparent, or beacon proxies, respectively)
* https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#ProxyAdmin[ProxyAdmin] (with transparent proxies)
* https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/proxy#UpgradeableBeacon[UpgradeableBeacon] (with beacon proxies)

*Since:*

* `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades@2.0.0`

*Usage:*

To use this task, ensure you have hardhat-verify installed:
[source,sh]
----
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify
----

Then import the `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify` plugin along with the `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades` plugin in your Hardhat configuration.
For example, if you are using JavaScript, import the plugins in `hardhat.config.js`:
[source,js]
----
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify");
require("@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades");
----
Or if you are using TypeScript, import the plugins in `hardhat.config.ts`:
[source,ts]
----
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify";
import "@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades";
----

Finally, follow https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#usage[hardhat-verify's usage documentation] to configure your Etherscan API key and run the `verify` task from the command line with the proxy address:
[source]
----
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet PROXY_ADDRESS
----
or programmatically using the https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#using-programmatically[`verify:verify` subtask]:
[javascript]
----
await hre.run("verify:verify", {
  address: PROXY_ADDRESS,
});
----

Note that you do not need to include constructor arguments when verifying if your implementation contract only uses initializers.  However, if your implementation contract has an actual constructor with arguments (such as to set immutable variables), then include constructor arguments according to the usage information for the https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#usage[task] or https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#using-programmatically[subtask].
